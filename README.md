# Housing Price Prediction using ML Models

- Applied Linear Regression and Random Forest on Boston and California housing datasets using Scikit-learn.

- Improved Boston model accuracy from R² = 0.67 to 0.89, and California from R² = 0.58 to 0.81.

- Reduced RMSE from 4.93 → 2.81 (Boston) and 0.75 → 0.51 (California).

- Validated models with performance metrics and actual vs predicted plots.
